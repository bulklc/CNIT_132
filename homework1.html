            Greetings! I've created this website as a student exhibit for the course CNIT 132 - Intermediate HTML and CSS at City College of San Francisco (CCSF). I created this introductory page per the <a href="https://ccsf.instructure.com/courses/41416/assignments/632255?module_item_id=1788871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Module 3 Assignment Page on Canvas</a>.<br><br>

            I grew up in the East Bay Area and went to High school in Richmond. After completing my BS in Mechanical Engineering at UC Davis, my MS in Civil Engineering at the University of Minnesota: Twin Cities, three (partial) Peace Corps Tours in Guinea, Cameroon and Liberia, and running a very small business in South India, I've returned to the SF Bay Area, potentially for good.<br><br>


            While I'm interested in computer science in general, I'm specifically interested in the field as it relates to my current profession in Civil Engineering. I work in a Construction Management division of San Francisco Public Works. Each of the construction projects I oversee requires extensive tracking and documentation, much of which can be done spatially. I'm trying to push my team to use online leaflet-based maps to do this. While I've used HTML extensively to build these maps, I know there's plenty of things I could of done better, as I was just learning the language while building them as a basic "proof of concept". I'm taking this class to learn how I can refine the methods I've utilized.<br><br>

            In addition to HTML, I have extensive experience in, and passion for, JavaScript, Python, SQL, LaTeX, Matlab and Octave.<br><br>


            There are countless examples of how web applications have changed our lives. And each is an inspiration to me as a beginning software developer. One such well known example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>. While there are plenty of strong arguments to be made about the poor quality control of this site's content, I find this system (and Wikimedia at large) to be profoundly helpful. It has managed to democratize information globally, while doing so with a relatively lean framework. When I was younger, the closest such source of information was Microsoft Encarta. While this was also a powerful tool, its static nature and proprietary structure led to its ultimate demise. I'm excited to see that an open-source, free, non-ads competitor has succeeded in such an overwhelming way, and its story has inspired me to work to increase accessibility to software and software development myself.<br><br>

            Like many of my fellow students, I also find <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">w3schools</a> to be an incredibly helpful tool. This free website (with ads) provides visitors with a wealth of articles, tutorials and MWEs (minimum working examples), all of which are critical to web application development. <br><br>

            There are also many articles online about the history of the Internet in general. One article on Techopedia discusses the Internet's history, including during the <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the-turn-of-the-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turn of the Century</a>.
