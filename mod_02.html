            This web page has been created in response to instructor direction provided on the <a href="https://ccsf.instructure.com/courses/41416/assignments/632254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Module 2 Assignment Page on Canvas</a>.

            Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is an aspect of website development whose importance cannot be overemphasized. According to the <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Webopedia glossary entry on the subject</a>,<br>


            <blockquote cite="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/seo/">
                "...SEO is the process of improving a website or web page so it increases organic traffic quality and quantity from search engines."
            </blockquote>

            This entry goes on to explain that a website or webpage developed with SEO as a priority will have improved chances of appearing on any given <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/serp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search engine's result page (SERP)</a>, even when the result is not "pushed" to the top of the results as a "promoted" ad.<br><br>

            Finally, this entry details several factors which play into a site's SEO. Some, but certainly not all, are detailed below:


            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keyword Density</strong><br><br>

                    A page with keywords which repeat often is more likely to be recognized as a relevant result for any given search engine which seeks out such terms. It should be noted, however, that many search engines are "smart" enough to recognize when keywords are not used properly (consecutive repeats, out-of-context placement, etc). Thus, only appropriately crafted key terms will yield an optimize search engine interaction.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Metadata</strong><br><br>

                    A page with detailed metadata, which summarizes page content, is recognized by many search engines as a higher-quality, more relevant search result. This includes all lines within the &lt;head> tag which start with the &lt;meta> tag.<br><br>

                    This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"></li>
                        <li>&lt;meta name="description" content="Page Description"></li>
                        <li>&lt;meta name="keywords" content="Page Key Word A, Page Key Word B"></li>
                        <li>&lt;meta name="author" content="Page Author"></li>
                        <li>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"></li>
                    </ul>


                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Links</strong><br><br>

                    Pages with generous internal links, external links, and back links are considered to have more credibility as they strategically route viewers to proper online sources.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security</strong><br><br>

                    Pages which load with a proper SSL certificate are considered safer and more secure, thus a better result to return to a user on a given search engine.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Speed</strong><br><br>

                    Search engines consider pages which load quickly to be favorable results for their users. Therefore, a pages load-time should be minimized in pursuit of SEO. This can be achieved by reducing content size, or having some elements load only when the user requests them to (via interactive elements such as buttons, etc).

                </li>
            </ul>
